Setup:
* 3. A local HTTP server:
    `python3 -m http.server --bind 192.0.2.1 8080` didn't work for me initially
    (could add a note: ~"run `...` after running the setup script")
* re-running the setup after reboot seems necessary
    (could note that)
* FAQ is a lot at once; I was happy skipping it
* 192.0.2.2 vs 192.0.2.1
    I don't yet understand which one is for what

Part 0:
* ioctl was tricky in a different language
